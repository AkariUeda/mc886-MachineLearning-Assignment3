## How to run the experiments:

* Firstly, you should have a directory named "dataset" with the word2vec.csv and health.txt files. This prepares everything necessary to run the experiments.

* You can now run any of the experiments with python3 with the following syntaxes.

```
python3 get_dataset.py
```
```
python3 exp1_kmeans.py
```
```
python3 exp2_find_medoids.py N K R
```
where K is  the  number  of  clusters, N is  the  numberof nearest medoid’s neighbors and R is the number ofrandom points you wish to plot.


```
python3 exp3_evaluation_metrics.py
```

```
python3 exp4_testing.py N K R
```
where K is  the  number  of  clusters, N is  the  numberof nearest medoid’s neighbors and R is the number ofrandom points you wish to plot.

Any further details about the experiments can be found in the report.
